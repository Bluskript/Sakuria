  "To know sorrow is not terrifying. What is terrifying is to \n  know you can't go back to happiness you could have.",
  "We are all like fireworks: we climb, we shine and always go \n  our separate ways and become further apart. But even \n  when that time comes, let's not disappear like a firework \n  and continue to shine.. forever.",
  "Those who stand at the top determine what's wrong and what's \n  right! This very place is neutral ground! Justice will \n  prevail, you say? But of course it will! Whoever wins \n  this war becomes justice!",
  "Fear is not evil. It tells you what weakness is. And once you \n  know your weakness, you can become stronger as well as kinder.",
  "Whatever you lose, you'll find it again. But what you throw \n  away you'll never get back.",
  "Fear is freedom! Subjugation is liberation! Contradiction is \n  truth! Those are the facts of this world! And you \n  will all surrender to them, you pigs in human clothing!",
  "I am the hope of the universe. I am the answer to all living \n  things that cry out for peace. I am protector of the \n  innocent. I am the light in the darkness. I am truth. \n  Ally to good! Nightmare to you!",
  "Religion, ideology, resources, land, spite, love or just \n  because… No matter how pathetic the reason, it's enough \n  to start war. War will never cease to exist… reasons can \n  be thought up after the fact… Human nature pursues strife.",
  "People, who can't throw something important away, \n  can never hope to change anything.",
  "I want you to be happy. I want you to laugh a lot. I don't \n  know what exactly I'll be able to do for you, but \n  I'll always be by your side.",
  "Thinking you're no-good and worthless \n  is the worst thing you can do",
  "Don't give up, there's no shame in falling down! True shame \n  is to not stand up again!"
